## A New Sponser, A New Website

This release of Bookworm is supported by [Capeds](https://capeds.org), A Japan based non-profit organization, founded by blind Sudanese professionals to support the education of persons with disabilities in Sudan. In February 2021 Capeds funded the project's infrastructure for the next three years, and sponsored the integration of Tesseract OCR engine into Bookworm.

Thanks to our sponsor, we're able to ensure the sustainability of Bookworm's development during this year. We also created this beautiful, highly accessible website to be the perminant home of Bookworm.

If you or your organization would like to sponsor the project or a specific feature, please [get in touch](https://getbookworm.com/contact-us/).
